# About NPM Registry

- npm is lots of things.

- npm is the package manager for Node.js. It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.

- The npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.

- npm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.

- npm, Inc. is the company that hosts and maintains all of the above.
