It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.\n\nThe npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.\n\nnpm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.\n\nnpm, Inc. is the company that hosts and maintains all of the above.\n\n\nLive Click NPM registry\nYou can visit the private NPM registry here: http://npm.clicksoftware.com:4873.\nHere you could see all reusable components/node modules/npm packages/angular libraries & all versions.\nNPM Docs with the live examples\nYou could visit the NPM Docs resource for all reusable components: http://npm-docs.clicksoftware.com\nHere you find the structure of reusable component, it's inputs, outputs, styles and a live example at demo page.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nWhat is npm? (full overview)\nnpm software and services lie at the heart of a thriving development ecosystem, but terms like “package manager” and “software registry” may leave you with some questions.\nLet’s start here: developers creating software to run on the node.js JavaScript runtime can vastly improve their productivity and the reliability of their products by taking advantage of time tested code rather than writing everything from scratch. But how do you find that code and integrate it with your project? These are the problems that npm solves.\nYou’ll run the npm client software to access one or more remote (network-based) repositories of software packages. You can view, retrieve and install packages shared by others in your organization or anywhere in the world. The npm client also allows you to publish your own packages, and modify and manage those packages in a repository.\nWhat repository? The npm Registry is a repository of open-source software packages hosted by npm for the Node.js developer community. Through the npm Registry, users can discover and download existing packages for use in their own projects. They also can submit and upload new or updated packages for download by others, including the ability to set permissions on the use of their software. In addition to transmitting hundreds of millions of software uploads and downloads per day, the npm Registry functions as a communication network for the community for analytics on the use of packages.\nThese features and functions of the npm client software are made possible by server-based software interfacing with a repository. The remote software provides the APIs for viewing, retrieving, publishing, and managing software packages in a repository. Access to the npm Registry uses software on servers hosted by npm. Using npm's hosted service is free for open source software, and private package hosting is available for teams and individual developers. Enterprise customers may choose to host the software themselves as a private registry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -

It was created in 2009 as an open source project to help JavaScript developers easily share packaged modules of code.\n\nThe npm Registry is a public collection of packages of open-source code for Node.js, front-end web apps, mobile apps, robots, routers, and countless other needs of the JavaScript community.\n\nnpm is the command line client that allows developers to install and publish those packages.\n\nnpm, Inc. is the company that hosts and maintains all of the above.\n\n\nLive Click NPM registry\nYou can visit the private NPM registry here: http://npm.clicksoftware.com:4873.\nHere you could see all reusable components/node modules/npm packages/angular libraries & all versions.\nNPM Docs with the live examples\nYou could visit the NPM Docs resource for all reusable components: http://npm-docs.clicksoftware.com\nHere you find the structure of reusable component, it's inputs, outputs, styles and a live example at demo page.\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the --prod flag for a production build.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via Protractor.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI README.\nWhat is npm? (full overview)\nnpm software and services lie at the heart of a thriving development ecosystem, but terms like “package manager” and “software registry” may leave you with some questions.\nLet’s start here: developers creating software to run on the node.js JavaScript runtime can vastly improve their productivity and the reliability of their products by taking advantage of time tested code rather than writing everything from scratch. But how do you find that code and integrate it with your project? These are the problems that npm solves.\nYou’ll run the npm client software to access one or more remote (network-based) repositories of software packages. You can view, retrieve and install packages shared by others in your organization or anywhere in the world. The npm client also allows you to publish your own packages, and modify and manage those packages in a repository.\nWhat repository? The npm Registry is a repository of open-source software packages hosted by npm for the Node.js developer community. Through the npm Registry, users can discover and download existing packages for use in their own projects. They also can submit and upload new or updated packages for download by others, including the ability to set permissions on the use of their software. In addition to transmitting hundreds of millions of software uploads and downloads per day, the npm Registry functions as a communication network for the community for analytics on the use of packages.\nThese features and functions of the npm client software are made possible by server-based software interfacing with a repository. The remote software provides the APIs for viewing, retrieving, publishing, and managing software packages in a repository. Access to the npm Registry uses software on servers hosted by npm. Using npm's hosted service is free for open source software, and private package hosting is available for teams and individual developers. Enterprise customers may choose to host the software themselves as a private registry.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
